# Singularity Layer MCP

MCP for Singularity Layer. Discover listings, manage endpoints and products, run payment-backed endpoint flows, consume public product and credit-pack purchase flows, and use wallet-session agent registry tools through authenticated MCP actions.

> ✅ **v1.6.0** Phase 4 agent registry tooling shipped on March 22, 2026. PAT-first auth remains live, and MCP now exposes wallet-session agent registration and management in addition to payment flows.

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is a standardized protocol for connecting AI assistants to external systems. It provides a unified way for AI models to access tools, resources, and prompts from external services.

The Singularity Layer MCP server exposes the broader platform through this protocol, combining marketplace discovery, endpoint and product management, and ERC-8004 agent access in a single MCP surface.

## PAT Authentication

Personal access tokens are now the default account-level credential for MCP. Create them in `Dashboard -> Settings -> PAT` and use `accessToken` for owner-wide MCP automation. Legacy endpoint keys remain supported for endpoint-scoped flows.

| Scope | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| `mcp:read` | Owner inventory, endpoint details, and stats |
| `mcp:endpoints:write` | Endpoint updates and webhook management |
| `mcp:products:write` | Product updates |
| `mcp:*` | Full MCP access |

> Live validation on March 22, 2026 confirmed that read-only PATs cannot perform writes, endpoint-write PATs cannot mutate products, product-write PATs cannot mutate endpoints, revoked or expired PATs are rejected cleanly, and PAT-backed endpoint top-up challenges now return a valid `402`.

## Discovery Tools (Phase 1 - No Auth)

Browse and discover marketplace listings, agents, and categories. No authentication required.

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `browse_marketplace` | Search/filter listings with pagination | type, category, chain, mode, search, sort, minRating, limit, offset |
| `get_listing` | Get detailed info for a specific listing | slug |
| `get_featured` | Get featured marketplace items | limit |
| `get_top_rated` | Get top-rated listings | limit |
| `get_agent` | Get ERC-8004 agent information | network, agentId, assetAddress |
| `list_categories` | List all available categories | none |
| `list_networks` | List supported blockchain networks | none |
| `list_agents` | List all registered ERC-8004 agents | network, limit, offset |

## Management Tools (Phase 2 + 2.5 - PAT First)

Manage your x402 endpoints and products through authenticated MCP tools. Use `accessToken` with a scoped `sgl_pat_*` token for owner-wide automation. Legacy endpoint keys in the `x402_*` format remain supported where noted.

| Tool | Description | Parameters | Auth |
|------|-------------|------------|------|
| `get_endpoint_details` | Full endpoint info including credit balance | slug, accessToken or apiKey | `mcp:read` |
| `get_endpoint_stats` | Usage analytics (requests, revenue, success rate) | slug, accessToken or apiKey (optional) | `mcp:read` if PAT is used |
| `list_my_endpoints` | List endpoints in owner scope, with safe fallback to endpoint-only scope | accessToken or apiKey | `mcp:read` |
| `update_endpoint` | Update allowlisted endpoint fields, pricing, listing flags, and webhook settings | slug, accessToken or apiKey, allowlisted fields | `mcp:endpoints:write` |
| `list_my_products` | List products in owner scope | accessToken or apiKey | `mcp:read` |
| `update_product` | Update allowlisted product metadata, pricing, branding, and listing state | id or slug, accessToken or apiKey, allowlisted fields | `mcp:products:write` |
| `set_webhook` | Set/update webhook URL, returns signing secret | slug, webhookUrl, accessToken or apiKey | `mcp:endpoints:write` |
| `remove_webhook` | Remove webhook from endpoint | slug, accessToken or apiKey | `mcp:endpoints:write` |
| `delete_endpoint` | Permanently delete endpoint | slug, accessToken or apiKey, confirm | `mcp:endpoints:write` |

## Phase 3 Payment Tools

MCP can now request payment challenges and complete endpoint creation, endpoint top-up, public product purchase, and public credit-pack purchase flows. Consumer purchase tools wrap the existing public purchase contracts only and do not act as a generic paid endpoint proxy.

| Tool | Description | Parameters | Auth |
|------|-------------|------------|------|
| `request_endpoint_creation_payment` | Request the x402 challenge needed to create a new agent endpoint | accessToken, slug, name, originUrl, walletAddress, chain, endpoint config | `mcp:endpoints:write` |
| `create_endpoint_with_payment` | Create the endpoint after a paying client returns an `X-Payment` payload | accessToken, endpoint config, paymentPayload | `mcp:endpoints:write` |
| `request_endpoint_topup_payment` | Request the x402 challenge to add credits to an existing agent endpoint | slug, topupAmount, accessToken or apiKey | `mcp:endpoints:write` or legacy `X-API-Key` |
| `topup_endpoint_with_payment` | Complete an endpoint top-up after the paying client returns an `X-Payment` payload | slug, topupAmount, paymentPayload, accessToken or apiKey | `mcp:endpoints:write` or legacy `X-API-Key` |
| `request_product_purchase_payment` | Request the x402 challenge for a public product purchase | productIdOrSlug, clientReferenceId, metadata | none |
| `purchase_product_with_payment` | Complete a public product purchase after the paying client returns an `X-Payment` payload | productIdOrSlug, paymentPayload, clientReferenceId, metadata | none |
| `request_endpoint_credit_purchase_payment` | Request the x402 challenge for a public endpoint credit-pack purchase | slug, walletAddress, clientReferenceId, metadata | none |
| `purchase_endpoint_credits_with_payment` | Complete a public endpoint credit-pack purchase after the paying client returns an `X-Payment` payload | slug, paymentPayload, walletAddress, clientReferenceId, metadata | none |

> Security note: PATs and legacy endpoint keys are passed per-request and never stored by the MCP server. Production PATs use `sgl_pat_*`, production keys use `x402_*`, legacy `sk_*` keys remain accepted, and older agent-created endpoints without a linked dashboard user stay intentionally constrained to endpoint-only scope.
>
> Contract note: product tools only wrap `/p/:slug-or-id` and credit purchase tools only wrap `/e/:slug?action=purchase`. Some current credit endpoints still include `purchase_url` and `credit_package` with an informational `Missing x-wallet-address header` field because that is the current upstream worker contract.

## Phase 4 Agent Registry Tools

MCP now exposes the worker wallet-session flows for ERC-8004 and Solana-8004 agent registration and management.

| Tool | Description | Parameters | Auth |
|------|-------------|------------|------|
| `get_agent_registry_info` | Get public registry info, supported networks, and worker route notes | none | none |
| `request_agent_wallet_challenge` | Request a wallet-auth challenge for registration or management | chain, walletAddress, action, payload | none |
| `verify_agent_wallet_challenge` | Verify the wallet-signed challenge and receive a short-lived session token | chain, walletAddress, nonce, signature, action, signatureEncoding, payload | none |
| `list_my_agent_bindable_endpoints` | List endpoints owned by the authenticated wallet or linked dashboard user | sessionToken, listedOnly | wallet session token |
| `list_my_registered_agents` | List ERC-8004 or Solana-8004 agents owned by the wallet or linked dashboard user | sessionToken, network | wallet session token |
| `prepare_agent_registration` | Prepare a wallet-first registration flow | sessionToken, registration payload | wallet session token |
| `finalize_agent_registration` | Finalize registration after the same wallet sends the on-chain transaction | sessionToken, finalize payload | wallet session token |
| `prepare_agent_update` | Prepare a wallet-first update flow | sessionToken, update payload | wallet session token |
| `finalize_agent_update` | Finalize the update after any required on-chain transaction | sessionToken, finalize payload | wallet session token |
| `submit_agent_feedback` | Submit reputation feedback via the worker feedback route | apiKey, feedback payload | worker feedback API key |

> Wallet auth note: MCP does not hold the wallet private key. The wallet signs locally, then MCP exchanges that signature for a short-lived session token. On-chain registration and URI updates still require normal chain gas from the same wallet.
>
> Validation note: production validation on March 22, 2026 covered wallet challenge creation, wallet verification, owned endpoint discovery, owned agent discovery, and EVM registration prepare. Full on-chain finalize still depends on the validation wallet having gas on the target chain.
